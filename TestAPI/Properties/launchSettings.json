/* 7/6/20 edit: I commented out the launchUrl at lines 15, 23 to force the app to
   open at index.html. I also separated the 2 localhost http address at line 24,
   checking to see whether that will fix the 404 error I get when I try to submit
   an update through the app. As of this comment, the 404 error is still there. */
